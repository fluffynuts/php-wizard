CHANGELOG of Wizard class by Dave McColl (davydm at gmail dot com)

Mon Oct 17 13:13:30 SAST 2005 <<<
	* bug fix: when a select input had no options (and hence, none selectable)
		(and I assume the same would happen if there was no selection made on
		a list of options), the summary page code failed hopelessly
>>>
Fri Sep  9 11:52:10 SAST 2005 <<<
	* enhancement: you may now use the wizard for a rather drab, flat form
		generation. In this state, the wizard doesn't do any of the rendering
		of neat bordering or titles or step numbers or any of that. And each
		of your steps is displayed (in order, from top to bottom), essentially
		flattening out the wizard
		-- this lead to some re-vamping of js validation code -- which is now,
			i think, a little smarter and neater.
>>>
Wed Sep  7 10:45:01 SAST 2005 <<<
	* enhancement: settings array can now take another parameter (yay)
		: "focus_input" is the input to focus on window load. If not set,
		then the first input on the wizard is selected. If set to __none__,
		then no focussing is done for you
>>>
Thu Aug 25 12:38:21 SAST 2005 <<<
	* enhancement: addhinput is a short way to add a hidden input -- just
		give it the varname and the varval -- the value is even passed
		through htmlentities() for you for free (:
>>>
Tue Aug 16 08:35:18 SAST 2005 <<<
	* enhancement -- radio and checkbox inputs have had a span to make 
		interaction more like a checkbox / radio in windoze -- now your
		personal scripts are added to this span as well, making the input
		fully interactive.
	* Obi-wan error in checkval meant that sometimes the first step in a 
		wizard would erroneously not let the user progress, after she
		went forward and then back again.
>>>
Fri Aug  5 16:39:52 SAST 2005 <<<
	* bugfixes galore!
		- so many bugs found in modlist -- but it's all good now (whee)
	* new DATEPICKSTYLE variable -- if set somewhere on your page, this will
		set the datepick style -- useful if you want the default to be 
		something other than what I chose (and I've switched to the popup
		version rather, since it's my code, and I can maintain it a little
		easier -- but the dhtml version should still be supported -- also the
		popup version looks a little neater, since it doesn't have to do
		tricks with underlying controls for buggy browsers (like IE)).
>>>
Thu Aug  4 13:40:26 SAST 2005 <<<
	* bugfixes
		- object event adding code fixed (extra quote)
		- checklabel scripts addition code fixed (load_array called with
			array arguments reversed)
>>>
Tue Aug  2 16:20:42 SAST 2005 <<<
	* bugfixes
		- textbox and text area validation works properly now -- they had
			an "out-by-one"-style error from using the onkeypress event for
			validation.
	* enhancements
		- add_object_event -> function allows adding of events to objects
			with known reserved names (eg "window")
		- demowidget input type produces a set of div's with demo widgets 
			in them (nice if you are using the wizard as a frontend to
			data capture to create more wizards (which I am)
		- extra array can take another argument for all input types:
			"tr_id" which sets the id on the table row containing the
			input, so you can make your widget dynamically show and hide
			inputs, based on the values of other inputs -- scripting of
			that is, for the moment, left up to you. But I may include it
			later. It's not all that tricky to do, really.
		- modlist input type allows you to capture a neat list of user-defined
			values. Not documented yet, but not that tricky to use, if you
			are a little brave. Remember to set the delimiter value in the
			extra array to something you want (or realise that values will
			be separated by a ;)
>>>
Fri Jul 29 14:19:24 SAST 2005 <<<
	* updates, updates, updates! all good here!
		- validation code bugsquishing contest. I win.  (:
		- better handling of javascript events against wizard inputs -- 
			using the javascript addevent code that I came up with -- not
			entirely on my own, there was some inspiration from 
			http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2004/05/26/addLoadEvent,
			although my implementation is generic
			What does this mean for the Little People?
			well, you can add javascript event handlers to any input now (as
			well as the label types), without fear that your event handlers
			will be overwritten (as they would have sometimes been).
			Input validation code is run *last* on the list of events for
			an input -- so note that bad code that you register against
			an input's events will prevent validation from taking place (since
			the code will stop at the last place of error), and you may end
			up with a stage that will not progress. You have been warned.
>>>
Mon Jul 25 11:35:11 SAST 2005 <<<
	* updates to validation code 
		- javascript validation between steps working
			properly now for exact values. I haven't implemented numeric 
			ranges yet,	but I'm not sure when I'll need it... so... unless 
			someone else needs it?
>>>
Wed Jul 20 11:51:05 SAST 2005 <<<
	* includes smartness updated:
		- we will look by default in:
			., .., include/, ../include/, images/ and ../images/
			extra paths can be added with the includes_dir and images_dir 
			directives: these paths are then searched first.
>>>
Tue Jun 14 10:56:52 SAST 2005 <<<
	* bugfix 
		- from wil@slagen.nl:
			fixed extra comma in js array (so used to php not caring!)
	* bugfix (also brought up by wil@slagen.nl, but fixed just before he 
		reported it:)
		- $vcontrols was not populating the js vcontrols stuff correctly,
			meaning js errors and things Just Not Working (TM). Fixed. Mainly,
			I moved from trying to use clever js array notations, to 
			long-winded, more robust js-code. I might apply this elsewhere 
			later, but for now,	I ain't fixing what ain't broke
	* enhancents
		-requested on wizard forums at phpclasses.org:
			added cascading select ability. Levering off of the Cassel class
			that I created (mainly for this purpose), selects can be defined
			that will affect the available choices for "child" selects. The
			"children" can be plain selects, or other Cassel-generated selects.
			Propogation of choice is insured.
		- The infobox/license "input" can take two extra fields in the "extra"
			array: height and width. These must be proper height and width
			identifiers, like "50px", as they are inserted into the html styling
			just-as-is.
		- images that aren't found are replaced with "reasonable" button
		representations.
>>>
2005-05-31: <<<
	Added some smarts for detecting the includes dir and the images dir.
	* should be able to use these scripts from the same dir as the calling
		script now, instead of being forced to use include/ dir (not that I
		recommend it)
	* should be able to find images in either <includes_dir>/images, 
		images/ dir parallel to the includes dir, or images/ off of dir
		of calling script. That's the order they are searched in, and if
		you have images in one that appears later, but one that is searched
		for earlier exists, then you will have problems (iw no images showing).
		You can also specify the images dir directly in the constructor.
	* includes dir is expected to be the same dir that this script is found in.
		You can overrid this in the constructor array.
	* included js files are also searched for, in dirs in order:
		1) dir of calling script
		2) includes dir
		3) parent dir of wizard's dir
		4) include/ off the parent dir of the wizard script
		5) lang/ dir off of includes dir
		6) lang/ dir off of parent dir
	  The last two are included for segregation of language files.
>>>
2005-04-11: <<<
	Fixes made by Will Merrell
	* Removed trailing , from js arrays in calendar generation scripts:
		this was an issue with MSIE, but handled fine with mozilla.
	* Changed button captions from "<< Prev" to "&lt;&lt; Prev" and
		from "Next >>" to "Next &gt;&gt;" -- provides better compatability.
>>>
2005-03-31: <<<
	* made the genopts function a little smarter with its options array:
		if is_hash is sent as -1 (default in all calling functions) then
		genopts tries to determine whether or not the options array is
		a hash array, and do the right thing.
	* new function get_unique_time_val to get a unique "time" value to
		be used in ids of items in the wizard (and for the wizard itself)
	* genopts now takes an optional thrid parameter: selected, which is either
		a single selected value (string) (for a typical drop-down list), or
		an array of selected values (for a multi-select list)
	* summary page code changed a little: where information for the 
		summary page is retrieved from a select / list, then the selected
		option(s)' text is displayed, not the value of those options
>>>
previous: <<<
	fixed bug in popup date selector javascript code generation. Should
	actually work now.
