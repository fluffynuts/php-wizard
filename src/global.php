	/* originally, misc.php requires this as an inclusion. But it's just to 
		make sure that pages which require the global variables defined
		in global.php don't have to manually include global.php, since
		they need to include misc.php for the functionality provided.
		You can, if you like, just comment out the inclusion in misc.php, or
		just use this effectively blank php file in the document root, where
		you have test_wiz.php
